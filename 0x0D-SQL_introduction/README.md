**Instructions and Sample Commands:**
The README file provides instructions for various tasks. Each task is given a number and a brief description of what needs to be done. The file also provides sample commands that you can use to test your scripts. For example:

Task 0: List Databases
- Write a script that lists all databases of your MySQL server.
- Example command: `cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p`

Task 1: Create a Database
- Write a script that creates the database hbtn_0c_0 in your MySQL server.
- Example command: `cat 1-create_database_if_missing.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p`

...

Task 15: Number by Score
- Write a script that lists the number of records with the same score in the table second_table.
- Example command: `cat 15-groups.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0`

Task 16: Say My Name
- Write a script that lists all records of the table second_table, excluding rows without a name value.
- Example command: `cat 16-no_link.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0`

**Note:** The commands provided are examples, and you should replace them with actual file paths and MySQL credentials.

This README serves as a guide for completing the project tasks, including setting up the environment, creating and modifying databases and tables, performing queries, and demonstrating your understanding of SQL concepts. Make sure to follow the instructions and complete each task to meet the learning objectives.

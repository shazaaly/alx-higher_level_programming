0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

### 0. Rectangle #0

**Description:**
Create an empty class named "Rectangle" using JavaScript's class notation.

### 1. Rectangle #1

**Description:**
Create a class named "Rectangle" using JavaScript's class notation. The class should have a constructor that takes two arguments, "w" for width and "h" for height, and initializes instance attributes accordingly.

### 2. Rectangle #2

**Description:**
Create a class named "Rectangle" using JavaScript's class notation. The class should have a constructor that takes two arguments, "w" for width and "h" for height. It should handle cases where "w" or "h" is equal to 0 or not a positive integer.

### 3. Rectangle #3

**Description:**
Create a class named "Rectangle" using JavaScript's class notation. The class should have a constructor that takes two arguments, "w" for width and "h" for height. It should handle cases where "w" or "h" is equal to 0 or not a positive integer. Additionally, implement an instance method called "print()" that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

### 4. Rectangle #4

**Description:**
Create a class named "Rectangle" using JavaScript's class notation. The class should have a constructor that takes two arguments, "w" for width and "h" for height. It should handle cases where "w" or "h" is equal to 0 or not a positive integer. Additionally, implement instance methods "print()", "rotate()", and "double()" to manipulate the rectangle.

### 5. Square #0

**Description:**
Create a class named "Square" in JavaScript that inherits from the "Rectangle" class defined in task 4. The "Square" class should have a constructor that takes one argument, "size", and calls the constructor of its parent class. Implement the "print()" method.

### 6. Square #1

**Description:**
Extend the "Square" class from task 5. Create an instance method called "charPrint(c)" that prints the square using the character "c" (defaulting to 'X' if "c" is undefined).

### 7. Occurrences

**Description:**
Write a JavaScript function that returns the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.

### 8. Esrever

**Description:**
Write a JavaScript function that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse()` method.

### 9. Log me

**Description:**
Write a JavaScript function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value in the format `<number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>`.

### 10. Number conversion

**Description:**
Write a JavaScript function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument. You are not allowed to import any files or declare new variables.
